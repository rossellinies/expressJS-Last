## Inspiration

- I created this repository with the intention to use it as a template for a business endavour I wish to create in the near future if possible. 
- A platform for upcoming web developers, photographers, graphic designers, creative directors, advertisers, writers, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in freelance work. 

## Challenges

- Video: I tried to insert a video in my project. I attempted to do it 3 different ways, but it didn't work. The video I wanted to use doesn't have a html address. I would like to know if there is a way to include a video MP4 in VS code.
- Adjusting the screen for mobile navigation. I tend to struggle to make it fit. 
- Coming up with a better name for the company and deciding the colors that will represent the business. I kept it simple with a combination of black, white, and grey.  

## Additional Notes

- I have little to no experience with html, DomScripting, scss, etc. I was somewhat familiar with liquid though. 
- Creating this project was challenging but also very fun.
