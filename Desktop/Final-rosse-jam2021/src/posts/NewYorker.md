## Are you a New Yorker?

New York City is such a diversified place in America. The most interesting is the people who are not born here, but they are in a New York State of mind. By reputation, the assertive, easily annoyed, and fast-talking person fits right in. This metropolitan city has carved out a unique home for you, no matter how small or insignificant to the millions of others it is.
Daniel Boulud said, "if you are not born here, to be a real New Yorker, you have to bring your talent, be a successful mentor, and support the New Yorkers who made the city by giving back."
